# Title

ASaiM: lessons learned from developing a framework for biologists

# Description

In this talk, I am going to introduce how we created ASaiM (Auvergne Sequence 
Analysis of Intestinal Microbiota), a framework to process and analyze data from 
intestinal microbiota, designed for biologist. I will also cover what I have 
learnt developing such a software

# Abstract

With new technologies and reduced costs of DNA sequences, biological data are 
massively generated. Such data are complex and require multi-step processing. 
While numerous tools exist, most of them are only performing one task, not 
interoperable, not user-friendly, and so one... That is a big deal for biologists! 
We are building ASaiM (Auvergne Sequence Analysis of Intestinal Microbiota), a 
framework to process and analyze data from intestinal microbiota, designed for 
biologists: simple yet powerful! In this talk, I am going to introduce how we 
created ASaiM, why we chose Python, but also what I have learnt developing such 
a software
